- it provokes the terrorists who will make the effort of taking down a plane against this method just to show that you can't hideux anywhere. 

- it will encourage a part of the people you ban to join the terrorists. There's a handful number of people who are in the hesitating and doubting phase about sharing ISIS's view. Banning Muslims and people with certain names will only show weakness from democracies, and only confirm ISIS's ideas about occident."

Do people who want to bring guns with them for genuine reasons plan a terrorist attack because they won't let them? Only Islam has this problem. That's why I want to ban them.

So you have no problem labeling the 1.6 billion people that follow Islam as being extremists, but when it comes to labeling the 3 billion people that are male as violent...that's just a bridge to far?

Refusing service to men because of the remote possibility that they may become violent is stupid.  You agree it's stupid.  But when talking about the even more remote possibility that someone who's identifiable as Muslim may become violent....that's a real threat."

Then you have instances like LeSean McCoy doing calisthenics during the anthem, the Ravens kneeling for the US anthem and then standing for ""god save the queen"" in the UK, and Marshawn Lynch sitting for the US anthem in Mexico, but standing for their national anthem \(cause Mexican cops totally aren't corrupt or brutal\).

I wish all women were that honest."

1961,">Straight Men what do you think constitutes as a gay man pushing their sexuality in your face?

Highly subjective, and whatever makes the person in question uncomfortable. Some are already offended if you don't stay in the closet, some are if you're broadcasting your sexual orientation (by, say, making out in public with a guy), some are if you hit on them and some are if you hit on them but don't take no for an answer."

At first it was a bunch of fuss about ""Mercury"", but what's in(or used to be in) vaccines is thimerosal which contains ethylmercury, which is natural (to use their words) and deemed safe. Methylmercury, the Mercury they're thinking of, isn't found in vaccines, but either way you can find a higher dose in fish or other foods.

Anyways that's all to say that they decided to reduce or eliminate ethylmercury just to shut people but but their still fussing about something that isn't even in most vaccines. So they did listen and make it ""safer""."

And some people don't develope full immunities from vaccines. Or the immunity wears off sooner than ideal. Which is why you caught chicken pox after being vaccinated and why I have to take the MMR vaccine. Immunities aren't binary, it's not that you are immune or you're not. Immunities are a spectrum."

You talk about deciding what is real news and that nobody should be able to tell the media what they can publish and what they cannot. Of cause you are right, that would be government censorship and nobody wants to do that.

But there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information.

This is the same as if a news agency writes a false story about you, that would be defamation and that is illegal both here and I believe in the US."

907,"As OP has stated, they like the taste of both whipped cream and marshmallows so taste of additive is not relevant for this CMV.  Stop changing the basis of the argument, this is simply whipped cream vs. marshmallows for practical addition to hot chocolate."
912,"But you are still cooling your ""hot"" chocolate with whipped cream. Milk doesn't retain it's heat very well, so you end up with luke warm chocolate milk"

916,"I think you're missing the point of this CMV. Look back at the title of the post. This is for discussion of whipped cream vs. marshmallows, nothing else."

928,Logistics aside whipped cream simply has a better taste and is more appealing to the senses
930,Best of both worlds use fluff
932,Whipped cream is cooler since it’s in the fridge. It also blends with the chocolate a lot more since it’s a really light foam to begin with. It’s taste goes along with hot chocolate better IMO.
933,I would only argue that whip cream makes for a better presentation.
937,"IMHO, it depends on the chocolate used. If the chocolate is not sweet, marshmallow might be better.

But if the chocolate is sweet, whipped cream is obviously better, to mellow it down.

The site is simply not suitable for a phone in my opinion.  Not having a dig at the site owners, it's to do with the nature of the content on the site.

My phone's screen resolution is lower than my laptop's and the tables don't fit on the screen properly.  Looking up trial mechanics is a nightmare too because of all the scrolling you have to do.

4190,"I think its primarily ethical reasons like you mentioned. Joining or being part of a community that reinforces the idea that abortions and contraception is wrong, well of course they are going to argue against it. Such ideas go against the norms and ideas of right and wrong for their group.

To make an analogy, it would be like trying to create a no pants law. Imagine someone came up with the idea of a no pants law, citing sources and statistics that this no pants law can prevent disease and unwanted children. People not wearing pants would make things uncomfortable at the least, so of course there will be some that fight it, in spite of the benefits. Imagine the uncomfortableness of this situation multiplied by 10 for the concept of abortions. Thats why people fight it., because it goes against their values and makes them uncomfortable"

4325,"My sisters aunt used to be a nun. She said that the nuns were made to sleep with the priests/bishops/cardinals when they all got together for what I guess would be holy conventions or something like that. She said she got out after she got an std and couldn’t do it anymore. She said they were passed around like it was a brothel, and orgies were also common. At the time, I didn’t give her story a second chance until I saw that Law & Order episode that had an almost identical story line."

The Democrats I see are fighting tirelessly for mental health, smart gun legislation, healthcare, education, raising taxes on the wealthy, creating new jobs for the middle class, taking care of the environment, and, yes, they find the time to treat refugees like people -- a concept foreign to Republicans when it comes to refugees...

No I'm not, I'm saying that anti-semitism is a *potential motive* for being critical of a nation's foreign policy in regards to Israel."
5533,"Well it depends on what question.  Most liberals want such uneven treatment stopped and half of the conservatives think we give to much aid and support to Israel.  Most Americans are sick of their politicians being bought on both sides of the aisle.

Still I will agree that most Americans side with Israel more than Palestine in the conflict, though I think most Americans think that the Palestinians are more of the aggressors than the Israelis."

Bernie sanders who got screwed over by his own party and then proceeded to join in the ranks of this party?

To that I say this. Come next election, don't look for money from me. I'm not in the habit of just throwing money out. If I donate it is for a specific purpose. A purpose the DNC claims is not actually their aim to do nor their responsibility. 

I promise you when the next election comes around this will be in the forefront of my mind. Nothing yet shows me that the DNC has changed in any manner other than lip service."

Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve. Things like sanctions disproportionately affect the average Russian citizen more than the oligarchs. What is really necessary is something more along the lines of overthrow and/or assassination of those in power."

When we stop being so tribalistic, and nationalistic then we can see each other as real people. We can overcome the hate.
